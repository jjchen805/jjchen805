### 👋 Hi, I'm Joshua Chen
**Actively looking for a full-time job in _data analytics_ or _business intelligence_.**  
In August 2024, I graduated from University of Washington, with a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration in Finance and Information Systems. To make better investment decisions, I like to use the power of data science to gain valuable business insights.  
When I'm free, I like to  
* 🏀 play basketball and watch the NBA
* 🚞 travel and explore the nature
