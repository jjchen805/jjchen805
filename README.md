### 👋 Hi, I'm Joshua(Yu-Shou) Chen. This is a place that documented my journey in Data Science.
#### **Actively looking for 2026 summer internship in _data science_ or _machine learning_.**  
I'm currently a Master of Analytics student at UC Berkeley, majoring in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research. Last year I graduated from University of Washington with a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration, majoring in Finance and Information Systems. Throughout my four years in college, I found my passion for using ML-driven approaches to gain valuable business insights and optimize strategic decision-making.
