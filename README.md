### 👋 Hi, I'm Joshua(Yu-Shou) Chen. This is a place that documented my journey in Data Science.
#### **Actively looking for a summer internship in _data science_ or _machine learning_.**  
In August 2024, I graduated from University of Washington with a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration, majoring in Finance and Information Systems. Throughout my four years in college, I found my passion for using data-driven approaches to gain valuable business insights and make informative investment decisions. Now, I'm pursuing Master of Analytics at UC Berkeley.
When I'm free, I like to  
* 🏀 play basketball and watch the NBA
* 🚞 travel and explore the nature
